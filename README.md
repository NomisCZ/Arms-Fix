##FAQ:
**1. Why do I see overlaps arms/gloves in spect OR after maximizing game?**

  - Because Valve -_-, but first person see it normally and if you don't minimize the game.
    
**2. Are all plugins supported?**
 
  - :white_check_mark: Yes, but the plugin **MUST** use our API in order to gain this plugin's functionality. This is up to the developer of each plugin to implement.
  
**3. Can I combinate SM Skinchooser and Franug's Arms menu?**
 
  - :white_check_mark: Yes, You can combinate SM Skinchooser and Arms menu without overlapping, but **you need Franug's Arms menu version >= 1.2 and SM Skinchooser >= 4.2.1**.

**4. What about AC gloves?**

  - :x: Currently not supported - combination of *AC gloves & Franug Arms* OR *AC gloves & SM Skinchooser* causes overlapping
